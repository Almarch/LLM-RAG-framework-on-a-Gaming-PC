# Run a LLM with RAG from a Gaming PC

The goal of this repo is to play with natural language processing with relatively limited resources.

# üöß this is a work in progress üöß

- ‚úÖ All services run and are properly served by at least one API
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some further APIs and associated functions are missing 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Coherent pipelines are to be developped
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some services exhibit questionnable performances and should be tuned or benchmarked

## 0. Set-up with Docker

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b12cbef1-98a9-4b79-bca0-fa1f21cb6f0e" width="200px" align="right"/>

The project is containerized with docker.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Almarch/NLP-from-a-PC
cd NLP-from-a-PC
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

Cuda is highly recommanded for performance. [Nvidia container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) is needed.

## 1. Services

The project contains several services and models, and strictly follows the philosophy: 1 model = 1 service. Some services aren't models though.

A vector data base is available in order to extract relevant context from specific fields.

A Jupyter Notebook is also here for development purposes.

### 1.0. LLM

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7847f4c8-b8d7-483a-aa43-c00241c15891" width="200px" align="right"/>

The LLM is pulled from hugging face. A [frugal deepseek model](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B) has been picked.

NB:
- The `{"role": "system", "content":...}` instructions do not work well. See the [doc](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B#usage-recommendations).
- As far as I understand the `attention_mask` error message should be disregarded as explained in [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69609401/suppress-huggingface-logging-warning-setting-pad-token-id-to-eos-token-id).

The LLM is proficient with a variety of languages including latin and non-latin alphabets.

### 1.1. Vector data base

A [vector data base](https://weaviate.io/blog/what-is-a-vector-database) is included in the cluster.

In order to feed the data base from raw pdf, 4 models are needed:

A python class `/services/jupyter/notebook/Resource.py` (will) encompasses all these steps and the appropriate API call to the models services in order to help integrating resources to the vector data base.

### 1.2. OCR

The OCR service is [tesseract](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/). It accepts any of the following languages:

<div align="center">
<div style="
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
    margin: auto;
">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom_%283-5%29.svg" alt="en"  width="40px">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg" alt="fr"  width="40px">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg" alt="es"  width="40px">
</div>
</div>
<br>

It has shown limitations, for instance this resource could not be processed: [this resource](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6342763/).

### 1.3. Tokenizer

The tokenizers are the transformer models from [spaCy](https://spacy.io/models/). There are 3 models, one for each of these language (the language should therefore be thoroughly mentionned in the API call):

<div align="center">
<div style="
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
    margin: auto;
">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom_%283-5%29.svg" alt="en"  width="40px">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg" alt="fr"  width="40px">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg" alt="es"  width="40px">
</div>
</div>
<br>

### 1.4. Encoder

The encoder model is [this one](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2). It takes as input up to 384 words, and yields vectors of size 768. It has been tuned using cosine similarity. It is primarily designed for English:

<div align="center">
<div style="
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-around;
    margin: auto;
">
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom_%283-5%29.svg" alt="en"  width="40px">
</div>
</div>
<br>

Hence the need for a translation, in order to avoid a language bias at this pivotal step.

## 2. Tunneling

It is sometimes easier to take a virtual private server (VPS) than obtaining a fixed IP from the Internet provider. We want some services from the gaming machine, let's call it A, to be accessible from anywhere, including from machine C. In the middle, B is the VPS used as a tunnel. 

Name|A  |B  |C  |
---|---|---|---
Description|Gaming machine  |VPS  |Client  |
Role|Host the models  |Host the tunnel  |Plays with NLP  | 
User|userA  |userB  | doesn't matter   | 
IP|doesn't matter  |11.22.33.44  | doesn't matter  | 

The services we need are:
- A jupyter notebook. It will be exposed at port 8888.
- A SSH endpoint. Port 22 of the gaming machine (A) will be exposed through port 2222 of the VPS (B).

### From A) the gaming machine
The ports are pushed to the VPS:

```sh
ssh -N -R 8888:localhost:8888 -R 2222:localhost:22 userB@11.22.33.44
```

### From B) the VPS
The SSH port 2222 has to be opened.

```sh
sudo ufw allow 2222
sudo ufw reload
```

Be careful not to open 8888 or the jupyter notebook would be made public.

### From C) the client
The jupyter notebook is pulled from the VPS:

```sh
ssh -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 userB@11.22.33.44
```

And the VPS is a direct tunnel to the gaming machine A:

```sh
ssh -p 2222 userA@11.22.33.44
```

Note that `userA`, not `userB`, is required for authentication ; idem for the password.
